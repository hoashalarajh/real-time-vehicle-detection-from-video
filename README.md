This MATLAB code processes a video ("RoadTraffic.mp4") in two main sections.
1) It enhances the video by removing noise and converting each frame to grayscale, saving the processed frames into a new video file ("RoadTrafficFiltered.mp4").
2) It isolates moving vehicles in the filtered video through background subtraction.
By doing this, the algorithm was capable of segmenting moving vehicles from the background in a noisy video.
